## Gameplay and Mechanics

### Main Objective
The player must control falling shapes (tetrominoes) to form solid horizontal lines. Completed lines disappear, earning the player points. The game ends when the pieces stack up to the top red line of the playfield.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Controls
*   **Move Left/Right:** `‚Üê` / `‚Üí` on-screen buttons or by hovering the mouse.
*   **Soft Drop (Speed up fall):** `‚Üì` on-screen button or a left mouse click.
*   **Rotate Piece:** Mouse wheel.
*   **Swap Piece:** Right mouse button. Allows you to swap the current piece with the next one once per turn. This action may cost some points.
*   **Ghost Piece:** A semi-transparent silhouette of the piece is displayed at the bottom of the playfield, showing its final position. This helps the player to place blocks more accurately.

### Scoring and Levels System
*   **Score:** Points are awarded for clearing lines and successfully placing a piece. The more lines cleared at once, the more points the player receives.
*   **Levels:** As the score or number of cleared lines increases, the game level goes up. With each new level, the falling speed of the pieces increases, making the gameplay more challenging. The current level and score are displayed on the side panel.
